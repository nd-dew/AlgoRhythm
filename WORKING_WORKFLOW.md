## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Keep Code Handy
The left panel always shows the latest code. Use it as reference!

### Tip 2: Iterative Editing
After pasting, you can edit the code directly in the player before pressing Ctrl+Enter.

### Tip 3: Quick Updates
For small changes, edit directly in the player instead of generating new code.

### Tip 4: Experiment Freely
The player is yours! Mix AI-generated code with your own edits.

### Tip 5: Save Good Patterns
When you find a pattern you like, copy it to a text file for later!

## 🎵 Example Session

```bash
# Terminal 2
🎹 [MOCK] > create a minimal techno track

# Browser: Code appears in left panel
# Copy → Paste into player → Ctrl+Enter
# 🎵 Techno beat plays!

🎹 [MOCK] > add a dark bassline  

# Browser: New code in left panel
# Copy → Paste → Ctrl+Enter
# 🎵 Now with bass!

🎹 [MOCK] > make it faster

# Browser: Updated code
# Copy → Paste → Ctrl+Enter
# 🎵 Tempo increased!

# Or edit directly in player:
# Change .fast(2) to .fast(3)
# Ctrl+Enter
# 🎵 Even faster!
```

## 🔧 Why Copy-Paste?

The Strudel web component (`strudel-repl`) doesn't expose a simple API for programmatic code updates. This is actually common in live coding environments where manual control is preferred.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ You control when code updates
- ✅ Review code before executing
- ✅ Edit AI suggestions before playing
- ✅ Mix AI code with your own edits
- ✅ More interactive and hands-on

**This is how professional live coders work!**
